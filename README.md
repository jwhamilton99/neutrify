# Neutrify

Neutrify is a Firefox extension that replaces all instances of "he or she" with "they". You probably shouldn't use it because it breaks a lot of stuff but if you want to you can download it [here](https://github.com/jwhamilton99/neutrify/releases/tag/1.0).

Seriously though don't use it it breaks lots of webpages

It runs automatically whenever you load a page and might remove formatting or just straight up chunks of html

Please don't use this
