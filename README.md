# Neutrify

Neutrify is a Firefox extension that replaces all instances of "he or she" with "they". You probably shouldn't use it because it breaks a lot of stuff. I'm not even uploading a compiled .xbi file. If you really want to use it you can download the code and compile it yourself.

Seriously though don't use it it breaks lots of webpages

It runs automatically whenever you load a page and might remove formatting or just straight up chunks of html

Please don't use this
